# AI-Driven Global Warming Analysis

## Project Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence techniques to analyze and predict global warming trends. It employs various models, including ARIMAX and SARIMAX, to provide insights into temperature changes and their potential impacts.

## Features

- **Temperature Prediction:** Predict future global temperatures using ARIMAX and SARIMAX models.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize temperature trends and model predictions using matplotlib.
- **Exogenous Variables:** Incorporate factors like CO2 levels and urbanization into the models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShuklaKrati/AI-Driven-Global-Warming-Analysis.git
